## Wins + Challenges 
Wins during this project included implementing a Post, getting data from an API, and creating the classes needed. Also, getting the login page to work.

A major challenge was error handling and calculating the total cost. This was huge as I learned how to iterate over 2 data sets to get the functionality of the cost working. Another challenge was creating a login page for the user to login.
